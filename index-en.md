<p>
In June 2006, the owner and management of Odyssea consider that why we not make a resort can provide better service for guests visiting us. So here Cocotinos, a boutique dive resort for leisure and relax, comes into the world.
</p>
<p>
The Cocotinos management uses the influence and devotes oneself to take all the possible opportunity to help and support the village school, church and others public utilities that are needed until today. 
</p>
<p>
The hospitality that Cocotinos provides to the entire guest will make you feel like home.
